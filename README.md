## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Order Count

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features

- Bar charts for performance by product category
- Customer segment breakdown by sales, profit, and customer count

- Treemap showing sales value (rectangle size) and profit (red = negative, green = positive)

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Customer segments** identified: Nurture, Reward, Re-engage, Reconnect — each with tailored strategies
- Sales, profit and order quantity have been increasing compared to previous years.
- While each year has fluctuations, there is an overall upward trend in sales, profit, and order volume from 2014 to 2017.
- Technology is the most profitable category despite having the fewest orders.
- Furniture generates high sales (comparable to other categories) but delivers significantly lower profit.
- Although there are more 'Nurture' customers than 'Reward' customers, the Reward segment drives more revenue and profit.
- The top 5 most profitable states are: *California, Washington, New York, Delaware, Michigan.*
The least profitable are: *Colorado, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Texas*.
- Some products with high sales have negative profit.
- Some top-selling products are unprofitable, indicating potential issues with pricing, discounting, or fulfilment costs.

## 🔧 Recommended Actions
- Review pricing and discount strategies for Furniture.
- Investigate high-sales, low-profit products as indicated in the treemap.
- Strategies for different customer segments — detailed breakdown of segment definitions and strategic recommendations can be found in `superstore_clustering.ipynb`.
- Reassess operations, services or marketing in low-profit states.
